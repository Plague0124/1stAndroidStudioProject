# 1st Android Studio Project 

This project includes a simple **input box** and a **button**. I made it to get familiar with how things work in Android Studio.

### What I Learned:
- Understood the concept of **Gradle** and project structure
- Designed my first UI using:
  - `TextView`
  - `EditText`
  - `Button`
- Wrote logic to show a **Toast message** based on user input
- Got comfortable navigating Android Studio 
- Learned about **SharedPreferences** vs **Room Database** â€” and when to use each
- Faced and solved several beginner bugs.

This was my first step into Android development, and I'm just getting started!
